  If you book a pitch directly with us via the website or by telephone, no
  advance payment is required. We only need to know the day of arrival, the
  number of people, plots and the approximate length of stay.

  We do not reserve any specific pitches. The reservation only assures you of a place in case the campsite is full.

  All customers can choose the pitch of the booked type they like best from all available pitches only at the time of their arrival.
