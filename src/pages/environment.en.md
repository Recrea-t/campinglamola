    description: >-
      Located in the middle of the Pyrenees mountain range, between Pallars
      Sobirà, Val d'Aran and Alta Ribagorza, it is the only national park in
      Catalonia and the centre of a large Protected Natural Area with more than
      200 lakes. Water is the main protagonist, with numerous rivers, ravines
      and wetlands which, together with the richness and majesty of its
      landscapes, flora and fauna, make it the most genuine representation of
      the high mountains.

      Los Encantats is one of the most emblematic peaks formed by metamorphosed limestone from the transformation of sedimentary rocks due to the temperature and pressure conditions to which they were subjected by glaciers.

      Currently, the only traditional and centuries-old use is the maintenance of extensive livestock farming by the local cattle of Boí and Espot.

      The Park receives more than half a million visitors every year: one of its main objectives is to make people's access compatible with the full conservation of all its natural values. This objective is impossible to achieve without the effective involvement of all its visitors. For this reason, their collaboration and respect for the established protection regulations is very important.

  - title: Alt Pirineu Natural Park
    description: >-
      The Alt Pirineu Natural Park, declared in 2003, is the largest protected
      natural area in Catalonia, with a surface area of almost 80,000 ha.
      Beneath the highest peak of the Catalan Pyrenees, the Pica d'Estats (3,143
      m), this unique territory is a reserve of Pyrenean natural and cultural
      heritage. It stands out for its extensive pastures maintained by the
      action of livestock and emblematic animals such as the capercaillie, the
      bearded vulture and the brown bear.

      The Alt Pirineu Natural Park offers a wide range of options for ecotourism all year round: discover magnificent high mountain lakes, enjoy the burst of spring flowers or the colours of autumn on historic trails, visit museums that show the present and past way of life of the inhabitants of a mountain territory, breathe in the solitude of the winter mountain on snowshoe trails, or enjoy spectacular panoramic views from a viewpoint.

      To access the interior of the area you must travel along mountain roads or unpaved forest tracks, for which you must use a private vehicle (preferably with a high chassis) or, if you prefer public transport, local all-terrain taxis. Alternatively, it is recommended to access the Park on foot or by mountain bike, using the extensive network of existing trails that often start in the surrounding villages.

  - title: Les Valls d'Àneu
    description: "Les Valls d' Àneu is a natural sub-region located in the northwest
      of Pallars Sobirà, a charming high mountain territory, located in the
      north of Pallars Sobirà, with stone and slate villages and peaks that
      touch the sky. It is composed by the municipalities  of Alt Àneu, Esterri
      d'Àneu, la Guingueta d'Àneu and Espot. It is bordered to the west by the
      Aran Valley, to the north by France, to the east by the Cardós Valley and
      to the south by Llavorsí. The river Noguera Pallaresa crosses the whole
      valley and is the most important fluvial artery in the area. Esterri is
      the nerve centre, both because it is a commercial centre and because it is
      the place where the main valleys converge: the Isil valley, the Unarre
      valley and the Bonaigua valley. In the town of Espot we find one of the
      entrances to the Aigüestortes and Sant Maurici Lake National Park."
